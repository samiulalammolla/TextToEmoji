# TextToEmoji
In this project, I designed and developed a dynamic web application that offers a unique and engaging approach to data encryption and decryption using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. The project aimed to provide a playful yet functional platform for users to transform plain text into a sequence of emojis, enhancing the security and intrigue of their messages.
